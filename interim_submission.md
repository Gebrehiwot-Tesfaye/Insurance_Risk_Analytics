# Insurance Risk Analytics - Interim Submission

# By Gebrehiwot Tesfaye

## Introduction

This interim report presents the progress of the insurance risk analytics project for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS). The project aims to optimize marketing strategy and identify low-risk clients through comprehensive data analysis of historical insurance claims data from February 2014 to August 2015.

### Project Understanding

- Analyze historical car insurance claim data
- Optimize marketing strategy
- Identify low-risk targets for premium reduction
- Discover patterns in risk and profitability
- Develop predictive models for risk assessment

## Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### 1.1 Data Quality Assessment

- [x] Missing value analysis
- [x] Data type verification
- [x] Outlier detection
- [x] Data consistency checks

#### 1.2 Risk Analysis by Key Dimensions

##### Provincial Analysis

- Identified risk variations across provinces
- Calculated loss ratios by region
- Mapped high-risk and low-risk areas
- Key finding: Significant variation in risk profiles across provinces

##### Vehicle Type Analysis

- Analyzed risk profiles by vehicle type
- Calculated average claims by category
- Identified most and least risky vehicle types
- Key finding: Certain vehicle types show consistently higher risk

##### Gender Analysis

- Examined gender-based risk differences
- Analyzed claim patterns by gender
- Calculated gender-specific loss ratios
- Key finding: Notable differences in risk profiles between genders

#### 1.3 Temporal Analysis

- Analyzed monthly claim patterns
- Identified seasonal variations
- Tracked policy growth
- Key finding: Clear seasonal patterns in claims

#### 1.4 Statistical Analysis

- Performed descriptive statistics
- Conducted correlation analysis
- Implemented outlier detection
- Key finding: Strong correlations between certain variables

### 2. Data Version Control Implementation

#### 2.1 DVC Setup

- [x] Installed DVC
- [x] Initialized DVC repository
- [x] Created local storage
- [x] Configured remote storage

#### 2.2 Data Management

- [x] Added data file tracking
- [x] Implemented version control
- [x] Set up Git integration
- [x] Established reproducible workflow

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Data Quality Challenges

- **Challenge**: Missing values in key fields
- **Solution**: Implemented data imputation strategies and documented missing data patterns

### 2. DVC Implementation Challenges

- **Challenge**: Large file size exceeding GitHub limits
- **Solution**: Properly configured .gitignore and DVC storage to handle large files

### 3. Analysis Challenges

- **Challenge**: Complex relationships between variables
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive correlation analysis and visualization

## Future Plan

### Immediate Tasks (Next 2 days)

1. Complete A/B Testing

   - Test risk differences across provinces
   - Analyze gender-based risk variations
   - Evaluate zipcode-based risk patterns

2. Predictive Modeling

   - Develop linear regression models
   - Implement machine learning models
   - Create premium optimization models

3. Enhanced Visualization
   - Create interactive dashboards
   - Develop comprehensive reports
   - Implement real-time monitoring

### Long-term Goals

1. Advanced Analytics

   - Deep learning implementation
   - Real-time risk assessment
   - Automated reporting system

2. Product Enhancement
   - Dynamic pricing models
   - Personalized coverage options
   - Risk-based discounts
